      # Imagine with me this scenario:
      # You are living in Spain and you have a store which ships to France.
      # Spain is therefore your default tax rate.
      # When you ship to Spain, you want the Spanish rate to apply.
      # When you ship to France, you want the French rate to apply.
      #
      # Normally, Spree would notice that you have two potentially applicable
      # tax rates for one particular item.
      # When you ship to Spain, only the Spanish one will apply.
      # When you ship to France, you'll see a Spanish refund AND a French tax.
      # This little bit of code at the end stops the Spanish refund from appearing.
      #
      # For further discussion, see https://github.com/spree/spree/issues/4397 and https://github.com/spree/spree/issues/4327.
