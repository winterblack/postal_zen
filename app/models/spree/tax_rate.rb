    # Finds geographically matching tax rates for a tax zone.
    # We do not know if they are/aren't applicable until we attempt to apply these rates to
    # the items contained within the Order itself.
    # For instance, if a rate passes the criteria outlined in this method,
    # but then has a tax category that doesn't match against any of the line items
    # inside of the order, then that tax rate will not be applicable to anything.
    # For instance:
    #
    # Zones:
    #   - Spain (default tax zone)
    #   - France
    #
    # Tax rates: (note: amounts below do not actually reflect real VAT rates)
    #   21% inclusive - "Clothing" - Spain
    #   18% inclusive - "Clothing" - France
    #   10% inclusive - "Food" - Spain
    #   8% inclusive - "Food" - France
    #   5% inclusive - "Hotels" - Spain
    #   2% inclusive - "Hotels" - France
    #
    # Order has:
    #   Line Item #1 - Tax Category: Clothing
    #   Line Item #2 - Tax Category: Food
    #
    # Tax rates that should be selected:
    #
    #  21% inclusive - "Clothing" - Spain
    #  10% inclusive - "Food" - Spain
    #
    # If the order's address changes to one in France, then the tax will be recalculated:
    #
    #  18% inclusive - "Clothing" - France
    #  8% inclusive - "Food" - France
    #
    # Note here that the "Hotels" tax rates will not be used at all.
    # This is because there are no items which have the tax category of "Hotels".
    #
    # Under no circumstances should negative adjustments be applied for the Spanish tax rates.
    #
    # Those rates should never come into play at all and only the French rates should apply.
